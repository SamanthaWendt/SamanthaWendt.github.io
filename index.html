<h2>UT CLUB TENNIS</h2>

<p>Texas Club Tennis at the University of Texas at Austin is a licensed recreational sports organization that promotes the sport of<br> tennis throughout the UT community and brings together all levels of players to practice and compete against other University<br> club teams around the state of Texas and across the nation. </p>
<p>We fall under the umbrella of the United States' Tennis Association's Tennis on Campus collegiate program. This division sprung<br> from the need for a bridge between junior and adult tennis for those not playing varsity college tennis and has grown immensely<br> since its inception over ten years ago. For more information visit <a href="http://www.tennisoncampus.com">Tennis on Campus</a>.</p>
<p>The Texas Club Tennis team has a rich history of participation and strong results at the sectional and national levels. <br>Some of our accolades include:<br>
<br>
2008 National Champions<br>
2012 Spring Invitationals Runner-up<br>
2013 Sectional Champions<br>
2014 Sectional Runner-ups<br>
And various other wins in Tennis on Campus regional events.<br></p>

<p>We participate in many regional events across the state, a sectionals championship, and send teams to the National<br> Championship and Invitational Tournaments every year.</p>

<p>With each year we grow as an organization and are adding new and exciting things to our club. We are looking to expand and<br> make a name as the largest and most respected sports club on the UT campus.</p>

<p>In addition, there are numerous social opportunities afforded by Texas Club Tennis. We hold socials, volunteer events, and<br> various other events that serve to foster a sense of camaraderie. People make life-long friendships through club tennis, and<br> we really strive to create a casual, friendly environment while still making tennis a big priority.</p>

<p>If you are interested in Texas Club Tennis we will be tabling various places around campus and at Party on the Plaza during<br> the fall semester.
